# ending the vote collector's joyride

software engineering unapologetically teaches you how often you have no idea what you're talking about

and you pay for it dearly with your own time

yet democracy legalizes spreading the cost of avoiding this lesson to everyone

benjamin franklin's, alexander hamilton's and george washington's "everyone's opinion is equal in value" is at the very heart of another well known "everyone's X is equal in value":

if not all labor is equal in value, it's because work is informedâ€”or shaped, by information having different value

so labor proves **not all information is equal in value**

and counting how often an opinion is shared by money printing couch potatoes does nothing but socialize the cost of laziness and fraud to individuals who work hard to reduce economic burden

systemaccounting eliminates the opportunity to exploit the **averaged value fallacy** and the arbitrage of ingratiating your way into authority ("you're equally right, citizen") so you can spread the cost of its failure to everyone else ("it's no one person's fault, citizen" or "it's the other party's fault, citizen")

changing vote weight synthetically is futile as it only compounds the problem

instead, banishing the weak algorithm altogether so costs aren't redistributed in the first place, is the fix:

i) enforce a conservation law on information, and
ii) eliminate its unequal access by publicly measuring the physical value of an individual's opinion

as a citizen, you might be used to hearing "you're wrong" from people who don't share your opinion

r&d heavy producers hear it all day from the universe as they ask it to "vote" for their opinions about where their work is headed

to welcome **everyone** onto a vessel navigated by the universe, and not 18th century colonials seeking to pacify an unchecked disdain for authority by averaging it out

citizens of a republic pursuing their "i do whatever i want" liberty will now hear the same response as producers whenever their counted opinions prove to exclude the one cast by the universe, i.e. so they don't end up navigating at the expense of those who are forbidden from ignoring that vote:

"and now you will pay for it out of your own pocket"
